# BridgeAid â€“ Unified Welfare Scheme Discovery & Application Portal
Developed a comprehensive web platform that bridges the gap between citizens seeking welfare support and organizations offering social initiatives, CSR programs, and government schemes.

# Problem Addressed:
Individuals struggle to discover and apply for welfare schemes due to fragmented information across websites, newspapers, and social media, often missing deadlines or facing complex application processes.

NGOs and corporates launching CSR initiatives find it challenging to effectively reach and engage their target beneficiaries.

# Key Features:

1) **Personalized Scheme Discovery**: Users can search schemes by keywords, categories (e.g., education, health, pension), sub-categories, and apply advanced filters (location, scheme type).
2) **One-Click Application**: Applicants can view eligibility, documentation, deadlines, and directly apply for schemes through the portal, uploading all required documents in their profiles.
3 **Real-Time Status Tracking**: Users can track applications and receive instant updates on acceptance or rejection.
4) **Organization Module**: Registered NGOs and companies can post initiatives, manage applications, review applicant profiles and documents, and approve or reject applications seamlessly.
5) **Secure Authentication**: Implemented user and organization authentication with robust session management.
